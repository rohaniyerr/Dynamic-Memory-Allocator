# Dynamic-Memory-Allocator

Honor code: â€œNo member of the Caltech community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the Caltech community." Those currently taking or planning to take Caltech's CS 24 course on Computing Systems should refrain from looking at these files.

Implemented malloc, calloc, realloc, and free using a FIFO explicit list with delayed coalescing and splitting.
